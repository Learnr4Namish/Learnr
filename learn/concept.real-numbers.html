        <p class="description" style="font-weight: bold;"><b>We all know that there are different kinds of numbers like Natural Numbers, Whole Numbers, Integers, Rational Numbers and Irrational Numbers. This set of all numbers is known as <span class="imp">Real Numbers.</span> However, question may arise that well we have different kinds of numbers, but why? Why is there a need of putting all these kinds of numbers into a group? Well, it makes us easy for us to identify all these numbers. It includes all the types of numbers that we see in our daily life and not only that, even what we so call as 'pi' which is an irrational number whose value is 3.14159265.. and so on, also includes in this set of Real numbers. Thus, no matter what kind of number it is, it will always be a real number. The world of real number is a vast and interesting world. So let's move on and know about this set of numbers. Look at the picture below to understand better.</b></p>

These natural numbers start from 1 and go on endlessly because we know that there is starting point of numbers but no ending point. Although Natural Numbers were quiet useful for us, they too had some disadvantages and were not ideal for representing things with no value or <span class="img">0</span>. <span class="imp">'0' doesn't include the set of Natural Numbers.</span>

           By the late 9th century, things starting changing slowly. This was the time whn Aryabhatta, <span class="imp">who invented '0'</span> was born. He changed our complete understanding of numbers that we understood before. He was born in India. By the invention of zero, we had another number set in our existing set of natural numbers. This is referred to as <span class="img">Whole Numbers.</span> Let's understand about this set of 'Whole Numbers'.

After the invention of '0' by Aryabhatta in late 9th century, it became an integral part of our number system. Our idea of number system changed and our number system started to develope slowly. There are different properties of Whole Numbers that we will learn in later parts of the chapter. Now we will learn about Integers, our next set of whole numbers and it's specialities.

                Integers are totally different from Whole Numbers and Natural Numbers. Unlike Whole Numbers or Natural Numbers, <span class="imp">integers neither have a starting point, nor do they have any ending point</span>. This means that Integers go on endlessly on both directions. Therefore, we say that <span class="imp">Integers are represented by the letter 'Z'</span> because of it's greek prounciation. They have two types of numbers, that is <span class="imp">positive numbers</span> and <span class="imp">negative integers</span>. Now let's look what a positive integer is by looking at the image below:-

            <b>
                From the above image, we conclude that positive integers are the integers which have a <span class="imp">positive or (+) sign or no sign at all</span>. This means that say we take a positive integer as 49, we can write it as either +49 or just leave it as 49, but it will still remain as a positive integer and not that it will change into any other kind of integer. We also got to know that all the positive integers lie to the right side of '0' if we represent them in the number line. Don't confuse what a number line is, after we discuss about the negative integers, i will soon tell you about number lines. I also earlier told you that we have another kind of Integers, that is <span class="imp">Negative Integers.</span> Now let's know what a Negative integer is by looking at the image below and concluding it:-

                A number line is just a simple line drawn on a paper which is used to represent real numbers. In a number line, we can represent all kinds of numbers. '0' is the reference point of all numbers on a number line. Given below is a simple representation of numbers in a number line:-

                    After seeing a number-line, a crucial question that comes to everyone's mind is that how shall we even represent all these numbers in a number line? Well, first of all you have to draw a line with <span class="imp">arrow marks on both points.</span> Now, we have to draw vertical lines on that horizontal line. These vertical lines are those lines that will help us to represent our numbers. See the image beow for further help:

            <b>
                I know that everybody can add numbers as usual, like horizontally or vertically. But I want that you also learn how to add numbers in a number line. Basically, we will be performing operations of whole numbers in number line. I'm not talking about the operations that are performed in hospitals but something else. We will be, in fact, performing operaton on numbers mathematically. What are the four mathematical operations? Yes, i know you know the answer, they are <span class="imp">Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and division.</span> All these four operation are the basic operations that we need in our day-to-day life. So why do we wase our time, let's dive in!

            <b>
               Adding numbers in a number line is quiet easy, isn't it? To add a number in a number line, all you need is to move to the right side of the number line. However, this addimg can't be explained but can be understood by you by seeing examples.

                <b>
                  What is being done is that the first number is always our starting number, ex 3  in this case. Now the last or the second number represents the steps we need to move in the number line, ex 5 in this case. So, we actually chose 3 as our starting points, move 5 steps to the right using <span class="imp">curved lines.</span> After reachimg 5 steps forward, the number on which the line stops is our final answer, like 8 in this example. Thus 3 + 5 is 8. But what about questions that have three numbers to add, like 3 + 5 + 7, nothing difficult, though there lies a difference between the two, the second one is also easy to do. Let's do that in our next example.

                Do you see how we have performed addition of Whole Numbers in our number line? Yes, it is as easy as that, all you need to do is to start from 3, move 5 steps and after you reach 8, then again move 5 steps further and we stop at 15, so you final answer is 15.

                    It is also easy to perform subtraction of whole numbers in number line. Let's take one example, say we take 5 - 3 and now solve that in a number line.

                What is actually being done is that our starting point was chosen as 5, the first number. And there you look, there is a minus, <span class="imp">(-)</span> sign. Unlike addition, we will have to move backwards instead of going forward. So, we start from 5, move 3 steps backwards and the final point where we stop is our answer. So our answer is '3'. Just like addition, if thre are two or more numbers given to be subtracted, you have to subtract again and again on the number line. Now is the time to learn about so called 'Rational Numbers'.

              <span class="imp">A rational number is a number which is written in the form of p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.</span>  What does that mean? This means that rational numbers are written as numerators thaat can be any integer but the denominator should alays be a non-zero integer, or we may get a value which is actually not-defined, meaning which doesn't have any value or which isn't defined in this very existing world. Have you noticed something else? Have you noticed the world <span class="imp">'Rational'</span>? Rational means that any number that terminates after a specific period of time or we can also call them as terminating numbers because there are certain numbers like 'pi' which is a non-terminating or repeating number having a value of 3.14159265 and so on and this also means that no matter even if you spend your whole lifetime finding the value of 'pi', you just can't! These numbers are called <span class="imp">irrational numbers</span> which you are going to learn very soon. Now what we will be doing is that we will be knowing about irrational numbers. They are just the opposite of rational numbers.

No matter even if you die or your son's son's grandson dies, none of you will ever be able to find the value of this interesting irrational number. We have learn't a lot about real numbers now! It is the time to do a lot of practice.
