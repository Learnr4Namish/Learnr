             Well, the first question that comes to our mind is <span class="imp">What is Motion?</span> You may see someone walking in a straight path, or even a circular path and so much. Motion takes place only in moving bodies. In fact, the opposite of 'Motion' is rest. A body may be at rest or even in Motion, but what causes the body to be at rest or in motion. <span class="imp">It is only because of Inertia. Let's learn something about this inertia.</span>

        <h1 class="" style="font-weight: bold; transform: translateY(0px); color:black">What is Inertia?</h1>
        <p class="description" style="font-weight: bold;">
            <b>
            A body at rest will always be at rest and a body in motion will always continue it's uniform state of motion unless an external force is not applied on it. This first law of Issac Newton can only be explained with 'Inertia'. Great! That's what I am telling. This first law of Newton is callled <span class="imp">Inertia</span>. Inertia means only that much! A body if it always wants to be at rest is said to follow <span class="imp">Inertia of rest</span>. And if a moving body or a bodyy in motion if it wants to always be in motion that too uniformly is said to follow <span class="imp">Inertia of motion.</span> We can also break the Inertia or in other words we can make a moving body to be at rest and a rest body to move or in motion. But how do we do that? Do you remember the last line of the law of Inertia? The last line of Newton's first law tells us that a body in rest will continue to be at rest and a body in motion will be in moton <span class="imp">unless an external force is not applied on it.</span> This means that <span class="imp">Force is responsible for breaking inertia.</span> How is that even possible? Let's see! Suppose you put a box on a table. Now tell me what inertia does it follow? Yes,that's right! It follows Inertia of rest or the body will continue to be at rest if we don't apply any force on it. So What is a force? Nothing but a pull or a push. So to make it move, I have only two ways, either I will have to pull it or push it because force is nothing but a pull or a push. So If i push the box, the box will start moving. Congratulation! We have moved the box! We have just simply broke the rule of Inertia! But You will say that no, just disgusting! The box moved but stopped after a certain period of time! So does this mean that Inertia is not a true law! No, to make a moving body to be at rest, there must be an external force acting it but you can't see it. Ok, let me help you with that now! Now rub your hands for a few seconds. What happens when you rub your hands? Your hands get heated up, right? Why does this happen? Only because of frictional force. This force is responsible for making our box stop as well as heating our hands up. So you see that how are Inertia of rest and motion connected to each other. Let's see what is motion.

        <h1 class="" style="font-weight: bold; transform: translateY(0px); color:black">How to define motion?</h1>
        <p class="description" style="font-weight: bold;">
            <b>
            A body is said to be in motion if it changes it's position with respect to <span class="imp">time.</span> This means that suppose I have body A and body B. Body A's starting point is 'a'. If we calculate the time and the body has changed it's position according to time, then we will say that the body is in motion. Motions are also of various kinds according to how the position is changed.

        <p class="description" style="font-weight: bold;">
            <b>
            There are different kinds of motion according to their direction. If a body moves on a straight line, then that body is said to follow a certain type of motion. We can say that as straight line motion, but you know straight line motion is not a correct word to describe it. So instead of saying that kins of motion as 'Straight Motion' We will say that <span class="imp">Rectilinear Motion</span>. Sounds good, doesn't it? Well, you know Rectilinear in it's most basic form means 'Straight Path'. For example A car going on a straight path is also an example of rectilinear motion. Can you guess what are the other examples of rectilinear motion? If you want to answer, then you can answer below.        </b>

                Can you guess what can the other type of motion be?  A body can also move in a circular path, right? So This type of motion is also known as <span class="imp">Circular Motion</span>. Can you give one example of circular motion? The movment of clothes in a washing machine, the revolution of earth around sun are alll the examples of circular motion because all these things make their motion at a circular path, right?

            <b>
                Can you tell me what do you mean by <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/period">period</a>? Period is a length of time during which some sort of events take place or happen, this is the dictionary definition of period. Now if we go a little deep and understand it in physics, it basically means that it is a particular length of time in which a thing happens. Let me help you understand this by giving you a very basic example that you come across every day. I know you have periods in your schools, right? Period in schools are arranged according the subject that the teacher has to teach. In a particular period, the teacher has to teach a particular subject. For example, If it is English period, then your english teacher has to teach you english, right? Now, What I am trying to tell you is that Period is a time in which some thing takes place, quite easy, isn't it? Now as you have understood the meaning of period, you should understand what periodic motion is, shouldn't you? Period motion is a motion that keeps repeating over a certain period of time. For example the blades of a fan revolving around it's centre and <span class="imp">Simple Pendulum</span> are all the examples of periodic motion. Did you notice what I just said in the example, simple pendulum. What is a simple pendulum and what is it used for? Let's answer that question now!

        <h1 class="" style="font-weight: bold; transform: translateY(0px); color:black">Simple Pendulum</h1>

                Can you see the image above, it's the image of a simple pendulum. <span class="imp">A simple pendulum is a mass hanged using a wire with a strong holding capacity and frictionless surface.</span> Are you getting confused? There is nothing to get confused. Definitions don't always give the clear picture, do they? We need to get deeper and see what's inside. Pendulum follows the <a href="/learn/concept.motion-and-time.html#period">periodic motion</a>. It get hanged up with the help of a wire or a <span class="imp">String</span>. The heavy mass suspended through the string is known as the <span class="imp">'bob'</span>. The bob may be heavy or light, but the main point is what I just wrote on the definition. The coming back of bob to it's original position after it's suspension is known as <span class="imp">Oscillation</span>. If it has come to it's original position 4 times, then the pendulum is said to have covered 4 oscillations. Don't understand what I just said? Well, Suppose I have a simple pendulum in my hand and I release it. It goes on it's way and comes again to it's original position. So this means that my pendulum has covered one oscillation. Now, I haven't applied any force, that is pull or push. It goes again on it's way and comes back again to it's original position. Now, my pendulum has covered 2 oscillations. Now if this happens 2 more times, then my pendulum will have covered 4 oscillations in total. This is what I wanted to tell you. <span class="imp">The time taken by the pendulum to cover one oscillation is known as the <I>'Time Period'</I>.</span> For example say I take one pendulum and I suspend it, It covered one oscillation and It took 4 second to come back to it's original position. So, in this case, 4 seconds is the time period for my pendulum. There are certain things that affect the time period of a simple pendulum. Let's have a look at some of them:- 
                <ul>
                    <li class="description"><b>The height at which the bob was pulled</b></li>
                    <li class="description"><b>The length of the string of the pendulum</b></li>
                </ul> 
            </b>
        </p>
            <p class="description">
<b>
    If you pull the bob of a pendulum to a certain height, then you actually mean that you have applied a certain force. The more the force, the more is the force and more is the time period. You are actually increasing the time period of that pendulum when you are pulling the bob to a higher height. But the question arises, Why? Since you pull the bob to a height, the bob has to cover more distance and that's why the time period increases. But a pendulum's time period doesn't depend on this thing. It also depends on the length of the string. Let's see.

                The time period of a pendulum gets affected by the length of the sting. Do you recall what a string is? You should again have a look at the <a href="/learn/concept.motion-and-time.html#definer">image of the pendulum.</a> Do you see the rope like structure through which the bob or the massive ball like structure is hanged through? Yes, that rope like structure is often called 'string'. The time period of a pendulum depends upon the length of that string. Look at the conclusion below
